## Application for the Shopify Front-End Internship (Fall 2022)

I used the [React](https://reactjs.org/) template off of replit, which is hosted at https://shopify-front-end-challenge.jarrodboone.repl.co/.

One important thing to note, I removed the token from this public repository because OPENAI automatically revokes the token otherwise. The application can still be found with the link above, however if you want to actually run it locally on your computer, you would need to replace the token in the code.

# Extra Features

I decided to spiff up the application a little bit by adding an Engine selection option. I also added functionality to save the prompts to local storage. That way, they persist even after closing the web page. I also added a clear button just so that the user can clear the prompts if they become too cluttered.
